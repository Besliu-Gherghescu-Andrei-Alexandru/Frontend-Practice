      In this video you will be building one of the best e-portfolio's that a
      recruiter will likely ever see from a junior developer. The functionality
      of this e-portfolio we will build is incredibly impressive and will
      definitely help your chances landing interviews.

      We will also be going over new concepts such as Promises, event listeners,
      light/dark mode, advanced animations/transitions and much more!
